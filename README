# 🇷🇼 Rwanda Unemployment Prediction Model

This project builds and trains a machine learning model to predict unemployment status based on demographic and household data. It uses a `RandomForestClassifier` to classify individuals as "Unemployed" or "Employed/Other" based on features like age, education level, household size, and more.
